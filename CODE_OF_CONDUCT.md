# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We want outprep to be a welcoming project for everyone, regardless of experience level, background, or identity.

## Our standards

**Be kind.** Assume good intentions. Disagree respectfully. Help newcomers. Give constructive feedback. Accept constructive feedback gracefully.

**Don't be a jerk.** No harassment, trolling, personal attacks, or deliberately exclusionary behavior.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel associated with outprep.

## Enforcement

If someone is making the project unwelcoming, report it by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers directly. We'll address it.

## Attribution

Inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), but kept short because we trust people to be decent.
